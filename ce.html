      Department of Civil Engineering Dr. Pankul Goel Head of Department The
      Department of Civil Engineering was established in the year 2014 with an
      undergraduate Engineering program in Civil Engineering. Since its
      inception, the Department has continuously grown and taken initiatives to
      impart quality education and inculcate research aptitude in Civil
      Engineering students. In the past six years, the department has seen a lot
      of progress in academics to enhance knowledge, skills and attitudes in
      students. This was achievable due to hard working teaching and
      non-teaching faculty and the support from the generous management. Our
      infrastructure has been state-of-the-art. The students are groomed with
      multi-dimensional skill sets covering all the required graduate
      attributes. Our focus is on practical learning, projects, and research.
      Students are given sufficient exposure to industry and encouraged to take
      up projects in this direction
