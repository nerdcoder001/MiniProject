      The Department of Information Technology is working hard to accommodate
      the ever varying aspirations of the younger generation because of
      increasingly changing demand and development in industries. We are putting
      our efforts to accommodate these aspirations by fine tuning the teaching
      learning process and with many other developmental activities. Our goal is
      to maintain excellence in education and to get global recognition. It may
      sound idealistic, but this is precisely our long term goal. It is what
      motivates the work of everyone in the department. It inspires our teaching
      and research. It is this goal which fuels the faculty members to excel.
      Our approach reflects the educational needs of the 21st century. We focus
      on our students by providing them with an outcome based education and
      hands-on experience through participation in innovative projects,
      research, training, and student forum activities etc. The success of our
      students and the teaching learning process is supervised by our eminent
      faculty, who continue to set the standard for excellence. To keep abreast
      with the latest knowledge, we organize various activities related to
      interaction with experts from industries; encourage the faculty members to
      organize or to participate in faculty development programs, conferences,
      workshops etc. We believe in continuous development and even during the
      ongoing pandemic & lockdown period we strive to carry on the best efforts
      and endeavors towards the benefit of the students. Our University results
      and placement speaks about our excellence with many of our students
      bringing laurel to the college by getting highest ranking in university
      exams and huge number of students are placed in national & multinational
      companies, moreover our studentsâ€™ creativity and determination is evident
      by this continuous success in various fields
