      impart quality education and inculcate research aptitude in Mechanical
      Engineering students. The department is actively engaged in research
      activities in various areas of Mechanical Engineering and related fields.
      Major research focus areas are composite materials, automobile, aluminium
      alloy development, alternative refrigerants and friction stir welding. Our
      expert faculties in automobile discipline also provide research
      opportunity in the development of four and three wheelers with a view to
      develop practical solutions in the development of automobiles. Besides
      this, other areas such as Robotics & automation (it is a Centre of
      Excellence), Pneumatic control training, etc are also covered for hands on
      training to young engineers.
